## Overview

The Smart Carbon Credit Tracking System is an end-to-end solution designed to address the critical need for accurate and transparent environmental monitoring. By integrating modern IoT, Edge AI, and communication technologies, this system provides a low-cost, autonomous, and scalable platform for tracking carbon emissions in real-time.

The core of the system is a solar-powered sensor node that captures environmental data, performs on-device AI-powered analysis for anomaly detection and CO₂ prediction, and transmits the results over a long-range, low-power network. A dynamic web dashboard provides users with intuitive data visualizations, analytics, and real-time alerts.

## Key Features

-   **Real-Time Environmental Monitoring:** Live capture of key environmental metrics including CO₂ concentration.
-   **Embedded Edge AI:** An on-device machine learning model provides instant, low-latency predictions and anomaly detection without relying on the cloud.
-   **Long-Range, Low-Power Communication:** Utilizes LoRa technology to ensure robust data transmission in remote or off-grid environments.
-   **Energy Autonomy:** A solar-powered design with battery backup allows for continuous, long-term deployment without manual intervention.
-   **Interactive Web Dashboard:** A responsive, user-friendly interface for data visualization, trend analysis, and system alerts.
-   **Intelligent Chatbot:** An integrated conversational AI to facilitate user interaction and provide environmental information.

## Technology Stack

This project leverages a modern, full-stack technology approach:

-   **Embedded Systems:** C++ on the Arduino framework for firmware, with an AI model deployed via Edge Impulse.
-   **Web Backend & Frontend:** A full-stack JavaScript framework for building the API and the responsive user interface.
-   **Database:** A robust SQL database for persistent data storage.
-   **Communication Protocols:** LoRa for device-to-gateway communication and MQTT for gateway-to-server data transfer.

## Project Status

-   **Hardware:** Final prototype developed and successfully field-tested.
-   **Software:** Web dashboard and firmware are fully functional.
